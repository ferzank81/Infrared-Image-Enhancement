# Infrared-Image-Enhancement

A new image enhancement algorithm based on the gravitational force and lateral inhibition network.

Problems such as low contrast, noise, and edge blur are often encountered in color infrared images produced by infrared cameras. To solve these problems, we propose a new image enhancement algorithm based on the gravitational force and lateral inhibition network.
